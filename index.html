      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How Does This Work?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><span class="p1">First, we will meet to determine what your needs are (i.e. frequency of dinner preparations — weekly, bi-monthly, etc.). Then we will discuss what your food likes, dislikes, food allergies and special dietary requirements are. We will then decide on your first week's meals and formulate a menu. Usually five entrees are chosen, four servings for each entree. This will provide twenty dinner sized servings, enough for two people for ten days—<br />
          Monday through Friday<br />
          —for example. This is flexible depending on size or preferences. <br />
          <br />
          Thereafter, you may call or e-mail me with your choices for the next two-week menu items. Usually every two weeks I will prepare these entrees in your home during the day. I will shop, prepare (using my own equipment), package (for freezer or refrigerator), and clean your kitchen.</span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Private Chef or Personal Chef?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent">A private chef is employed by one individual or family full time, and is often “living in” and preparing up to three meals per day. A personal chef serves several clients, usually one per day, and provides multiple meals that are custom designed for the clients' particular requests and requirements. These meals are packaged and stored so that clients may enjoy them at their leisure in the future.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Do You Cook in My Kitchen?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><span class="p1">Yes, I do prepare your meals in the safety of your own kitchen. On our agreed upon cooking date I will bring the fresh ingredients for your meals along with my own pots, pans and utensils, and prepare your entrees on site. At the end of the day I will leave your kitchen clean and full of the aroma of good home cooking!</span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How Long Will You Be Here?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><span class="p1">I’ll be cooking several different entrees and side dishes from scratch, so it will take several hours. I am most willing to work with your schedule or situation, and make arrangements in advance so that my cooking date fits into your schedule.</span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">Do I Heat the Food?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><span class="p1">Yes. Any entrees that have been stored for you in your freezer should be defrosted overnight in your refrigerator, and heated, to be enjoyed at the peak of their flavor. I always leave you with easy to follow heating instructions for each entree.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How Much Freezer Space is Needed?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><span class="p1">It depends on the number of meals you request, and the sizes of the containers, but it does generally require a considerable amount of freezer space. Why don’t we take a look at your freezer to see just how much room you have available? Efficient storage is one of the reasons I prefer to select the appropriate size, uniform storage containers for my clients.</span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How Long Will the Food Last?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><span class="p1">Depending on how many entrees you order, and how many evenings you eat at home we can determine approximately how long your meals will last. If you travel for business, or entertain in restaurants during the week, or just enjoy eating out on occasion the meals will take you further than if you eat one each night.</span></div>
      </div>
      <div class="AccordionPanel">
        <div class="AccordionPanelTab">How Often Will We Need Your Service?</div>
        <div class="AccordionPanelContent"><span class="p1">I’ll be happy to help you determine just how often you will want to schedule my Personal Chef Service to best serve your needs. I'll make sure it supports your busy lifestyle without putting any pressure on you.</span></div>
